# Context of study

"The explosion that tore through the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig last April 20, as the rig’s crew completed drilling the exploratory Macondo well deep under the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, began a human, economic, and environmental disaster.
Eleven crew members died, and others were seriously injured, as fire engulfed and
ultimately destroyed the rig. And, although the nation would not know the full scope
of the disaster for weeks, the first of more than four million barrels of oil began gushing uncontrolled into the Gulf—threatening livelihoods, precious habitats, and even a unique way of life. A treasured American landscape, already battered and degraded from years of mismanagement, faced yet another blow as the oil spread and washed ashore. Five years after Hurricane Katrina, the nation was again transfixed, seemingly helpless, as this new tragedy unfolded in the Gulf. The costs from this one industrial accident are not yet fully counted, but it is already clear that the impacts on the region’s natural systems and people were enormous, and that economic losses total tens of billions of dollars.

On May 22, 2010, President Barack Obama announced the creation of the National
Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling: an independent, nonpartisan entity, directed to provide a thorough analysis and impartial judgment. The President charged the Commission to determine the causes of the disaster, and to improve the country’s ability to respond to spills, and to recommend reforms to make offshore energy production safer. And the President said we were to follow the facts wherever they led." 

**Falar do contexto do projeto e como isso ajuda na formação dos indicadores**


# Study goal

The purpuse of this study is to discover knowledge about the causes of disasters in the oil and gas industries, in order to support the establishment of indicators in the Human Factors II Project (Libra Consortium, Brazil, 2007 - 2022).

## Research question

**Which indicators we can extract from The Gulf Oil Disaster Report?** 

# Methods, Materials and Techniques

 **Descrever método ao finalizar as analises**

NormalizaParaTextMining <- function(texto){
 
  # Normaliza texto
  texto %>% 
    chartr(
      old = "áéíóúÁÉÍÓÚýÝàèìòùÀÈÌÒÙâêîôûÂÊÎÔÛãõÃÕñÑäëïöüÄËÏÖÜÿçÇ´`^~¨:.!?&$@#0123456789",

    str_squish() %>% # Elimina espacos excedentes 
    tolower() %>% # Converte para minusculo
    return() # Retorno da funcao
}
```

**Text Cleaning Function**


```r
# Função para Palavras que podem se retiradas

# Lista de palavras para remover
palavrasRemover <- c(stopwords(kind = "en"), letters) %>%
  as.tibble() %>% 
  rename(Palavra = value) %>% 
  mutate(Palavra = NormalizaParaTextMining(Palavra))
```

```
## Warning: `as.tibble()` is deprecated, use `as_tibble()` (but mind the new semantics).
## This warning is displayed once per session.
```

**Read PDF**


```r
# Arquivo pdf
arquivoPdf <- "https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-OILCOMMISSION/pdf/GPO-OILCOMMISSION.pdf"
```

**Tidynd text**


```r
TidyT <- arquivoPdf %>% 
  read_pdf() %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  select(text) 
```
  
# Unigrams analysis

**Cleaning useless words for single word analysis**


```r
  CleanW <- TidyT  %>% 
  unnest_tokens(Palavra, text) %>% 
  mutate(Palavra = NormalizaParaTextMining(Palavra)) %>% 
  anti_join(palavrasRemover)
```

```
## Joining, by = "Palavra"
```
  
**Counting single words**


```r
  frequenciaPalavras <-  CleanW  %>% 
  count(Palavra, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(Palavra != "") %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 


# Visualiza frequencia de palavras
DT::datatable(frequenciaPalavras)
```

# Correlation betweeen Pairwise words

We may instead want to examine correlation among words, which indicates how often they appear together relative to how often they appear separately.

In particular, here we’ll focus on the phi coefficient, a common measure for binary correlation. The focus of the phi coefficient is how much more likely it is that either both word X and Y appear, or neither do, than that one appears without the other.

The phi coefficient is equivalent to the Pearson correlation, which you may have heard of elsewhere, when it is applied to binary data).

The pairwise_cor() function in widyr lets us find the phi coefficient between words based on how often they appear in the same section. Its syntax is similar to pairwise_count().



```r
library(widyr)
# we need to filter for at least relatively common words first
word_cor <- par_Palavras %>%
  group_by(word1) %>%
  filter(n() >= 50) %>%
  widyr::pairwise_cor(word1,word2, sort = TRUE)
```

## Correlation Barplot of top 


```r

  filter(item1 %in% c("oil", "spill", "deepwater", "response", "safety", "enviromental", "bp")) %>%
  group_by(item1) %>%
  arrange(desc(item1))%>%
  top_n(12) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(item2 = reorder(item2, correlation)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(item2, correlation, fill = item1)) +
